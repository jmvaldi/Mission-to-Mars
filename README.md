# Mission-to-Mars
This project is about scrapping data from multiple websites to stay updated on the mission to mars. The extracted data will be stored in a NoSQL database and then rendered in a web application created with Flask. BeautifulSoup and Splinter are used to scrape images of Mar's hemispheres.
